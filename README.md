# twitch-giveaway-chatbot
Twitch giveaway chatbot with increasing luck for every giveaway a user participates in but does not win.
Subscribers receive additional luck depending on their subscription tier. The amount of luck can be changed in the config.
Optionally sends giveaway reminders to chat and punishes user who participate but won't claim the prize.
The bot requires a TMI token, an Access token and your client ID.
